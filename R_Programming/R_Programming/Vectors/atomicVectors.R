# So vectors are the most basic data structure in R, and they must contain elements of the same class.
# Diff types of vectors
# Logical vector - c() is used to create vector
a<-c(T, F, T)

# Integer vectors
i<-c(1,9, 10, 123)

# Double vectors
d <- c(1.232, 1.234, 3.14)

# Character vector
ch <- c("g", "h", "a")
